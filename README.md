# 👋 Hey there! I'm Rishi.

I'm a student at **Trinity College Dublin** with a passion for Technology and Finance 📚💼. When I'm not hitting the books, you'll find me diving into research and working on practical projects — because why settle for ordinary when you can create something extraordinary? 🚀

## 🛠️ My Projects

### [Querius](https://github.com/r-kataria/Querius)
Querius is a pure Python in-memory SQL engine, developed from scratch. Looking inside SQL? Querius is a Pythonic lens to SQL 🐍🔍

### [FaunaDo](https://github.com/r-kataria/FaunaDo)
FaunaDo is a simple to-do list with real-time synchronization, implemented with FaunaDB and Next.js. Leveraging serverless architecture for scalability and flexibility. ☁️✨

### [Probabilistic](https://github.com/r-kataria/Probabilistic)
Probabilistic is a cross-language standard for probabilistic function execution, with implementations in [Python](https://github.com/r-kataria/Probabilistic.py) and [C](https://github.com/r-kataria/Probabilistic.c). Adding a touch of randomness to your functions! 🔮🐍

### [SimpliC](https://github.com/r-kataria/SimpliC)
SimpliC is a simple HTTP web server written in C. Because sometimes, less is more. ⚡️🚀

## 🔍 Explorations

### [Merciful Stalin Sort](https://github.com/r-kataria/MercifulStalinSort)
Merciful Stalin Sort is an experimental sorting algorithm inspired by the notorious **Stalin Sort**. Instead of discarding out-of-order elements, it retains those in sorted order and recursively sorts the remaining elements. 🧩📶

### [Access Alchemy](https://github.com/r-kataria/AccessAlchemy)
Access Alchemy explores how obtaining additional visas and travel documents can significantly boost the strength of a passport. By modeling visa relationships as graphs, it helps optimize their global mobility. 🌍✈️

## 💼 Interests

- **Technology**: I love tinkering with different languages and frameworks. 🖥️💡
- **Finance**: Numbers, markets, and the occasional stock tip. 📈💰

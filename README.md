# 👋 Hey there! I'm Rishi.

**Aspiring Computer Scientist + More!**

I'm a computer science student at Trinity College Dublin, with a focus on technology-driven problem-solving. My interests span crafting novel solutions, exploring the intersections of technology with fields like finance and politics, and conducting research to push boundaries. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me diving into anime, creating playlists, or exploring new cities.

## 🛠️ My Projects

### 
[**Querius**](https://github.com/r-kataria/Querius): A pure Python in-memory SQL engine, developed from scratch. Looking inside SQL? Querius is a Pythonic lens to SQL 🐍🔍

[**FaunaDo**](https://github.com/r-kataria/FaunaDo) A simple to-do list with real-time synchronization, implemented with FaunaDB and Next.js. Leveraging serverless architecture for scalability and flexibility. ☁️✨

[**Probabilistic**](https://github.com/r-kataria/Probabilistic): A cross-language standard for probabilistic function execution, with implementations in [Python](https://github.com/r-kataria/Probabilistic.py) and [C](https://github.com/r-kataria/Probabilistic.c). Adding a touch of randomness to your functions! 🔮🐍

[**SimpliC**](https://github.com/r-kataria/SimpliC): A simple HTTP web server written in C. Because sometimes, less is more. ⚡️🚀

[**MiniMiner**](https://github.com/r-kataria/MiniMiner): An experiment in mining Bitcoin on MicroPython-enabled devices (like Calculators). 🪙⛏️

[**Lake**](https://github.com/r-kataria/Lake): An adaptive, incremental machine learning data structure with a simple API for real-time data integration and prediction. 💧🧠


## 🔍 Explorations

[**Merciful Stalin Sort**](https://github.com/r-kataria/MercifulStalinSort): An experimental sorting algorithm inspired by the notorious **Stalin Sort**. Instead of discarding out-of-order elements, it retains those in sorted order and recursively sorts the remaining elements. 🧩📶


[**Access Alchemy**](https://github.com/r-kataria/AccessAlchemy): Exploring how obtaining additional visas and travel documents can significantly boost the strength of a passport. By modeling visa relationships as graphs, it helps optimize their global mobility. 🌍✈️


## 📚 From My Coursework

[**CSU22012-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-II-Notes**](https://github.com/r-kataria/CSU22012-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-II-Notes): Algorithms and data structures, distilled into concise, easy-to-follow notes. 📚✨

[**CSU22012-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-II-Constraint-Programming-Project**](https://github.com/r-kataria/CSU22012-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-II-Constraint-Programming-Project): A Java-based constraint solver using backtracking. 🧩⚙️

[**CSU44052-Computer-Graphics-Todhchai**](https://github.com/r-kataria/CSU44052-Computer-Graphics-Todhchai): An OpenGL render envisioning a futuristic Emerald Isle. 🌌🍀

## 🔄 Current Work

**Political Stonks** Looking at the correlation between US Presidential General Elections and Primary polling with stock market performance. This analysis includes both index and individual stocks, utilizing data that dates back to the 1960s. 📊🇺🇸
